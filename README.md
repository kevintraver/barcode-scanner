# barcode-scanner

This codebase provides a basic camera barcode scanner that can scan food product barcodes and provide details.

## Motivation

Currently at Woolworths, laser scanners are used with Android devices for picking online shopping orders at warehouses. Laser scanners have been effective for decades in scanning barcodes. However, mobile phones with built-in cameras and powerful hardware are now available at low cost, compared to packaged phone devices bundled with a laser scanner that are then sold by a 3rd party company. 

Why not try to leverage off the full capability of a standard Android device? The camera can then be used for barcode scanning, without relying on additional hardware such as a laser that will need to be bolted to the device.

## Advantages

1. Massive savings due to not requiring expensive 3rd party vendor devices.
2. Ability to upgrade Android operating systems and keep up to date, due to not being tied to a vendor packaged Android versions.
3. Any android phone will work.
4. Camera scanners are more versatile and intelligent e.g. it can read barodes that are creased or warped in shape.
5. No need to use 3rd party vendor plugins for such laser hardware.
6. Provides alot more flexibility in future development of scanner software for WooliesX.

## Disadvantages

1. Camera will not scan at distance range like laser
